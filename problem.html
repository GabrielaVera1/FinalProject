  <h12> Global warming is the long-term warming of the planet's overall temperature. Under normal conditions, this keeps the average temperature of Earth's surface at a level that is compatible with life. However, these elevated atmospheric CO2 levels have insulated our planet even more, acting like a thick, wool coat trapping more heat here on Earth. As a result, stronger storms, heavier rains, and longer droughts are all becoming more common as global average temperatures rise. Though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels. Whether it’s dirty coal, oil, or fracked gas, our dependence on fossil fuels is driving changes to the earth’s climate by causing something known as the "greenhouse effect", which is when some gases in the Earth's atmosphere act a bit like the glass in a greenhouse, trapping the sun's heat and stopping it from leaking back into space and causing global warming. Which brings more drought and higher temperatures that make it easy for fires to start and spread, and in turn those blazes release more climate-changing carbon into the atmosphere as they burn through forests and peatland. The loss of forests impact the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to the fact that trees usually absorb said gases. Due to the abnormal amount of greenhouse gases global temperatures have been above average and steadily rising since the 1970s. This chart demonstrates the change in temperature, with blue representing temperatures below the global average and red representing temperatures above the global average. Today, we are already seeing the severe effects from increasing global average temperatures. Weather events are becoming more frequent and severe, and sea levels are rising and threatening coastal cities around the globe. </h12>
