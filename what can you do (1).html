<h12> There are many things you can do in your day to day life that help fight climate change, for example, instead of getting in the car, walk or cycle – and enjoy the physical and mental health benefits, and the money saved. For longer journeys, use public transport, or try car sharing schemes. Because not only do cars contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, but air pollution caused by exhaust fumes from traffic poses a serious threat to public health. Eat fewer or smaller portions of meat, especially red meat, which has the largest environmental impact.  Don’t waste food, one-third of all food produced is either lost or wasted. According to UNEP’s (United Nations Environment Programme) Food Waste Index Report 2021, people globally waste 1 billion tonnes of food each year, which accounts for around 8-10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Avoid waste by only buying what you need and take advantage of every edible part of the foods you purchase. Measure portion sizes of rice and other staples before cooking them, store food correctly (use your freezer if you have one), be creative with leftovers, share extras with your friends and neighbours and contribute to a local food-sharing scheme. Make compost out of inedible remnants and use it to fertilize your garden. Composting is one of the best options for managing organic waste while also reducing environmental impacts. Plant a tree, as trees grow, they help stop climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the air, storing carbon in the trees and soil, and releasing oxygen into the atmosphere. Much of our electricity and heat runs on coal, oil and gas. Save energy at home, use less energy by reducing heating and air conditioning, switching to LED light bulbs and energy-efficient appliances, washing clothes in cold water, or hanging wet clothes instead of using the dryer. Finally, the four Rs, reduce, reuse, repair and recycle, electronics, clothing and other items we buy generate carbon emissions at every link in the production chain, from extracting raw materials to manufacturing and transporting products to market. To protect our climate, buy less, buy second-hand, repair what you can, and recycle.</h12>
